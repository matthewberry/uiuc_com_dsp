You might also want to refer to the [R documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Important Note**: After a period of inactivity (Google does not specify exactly how long), Google will disconnect your notebook from the virtual machine that had been running it. When you return, Google will connect to a new virtual machine. **If this happens and you find cells that previously ran without error have suddenly stopped working, re-run all of the notebook's cells again, starting at the top.**\n",

        "2. Check the currently active Google account on this notebook. Look near the top-right corner of the screen for either a `Sign In` button or a round icon containing either a letter or your profile photo. If you see a `Sign In` button, click it and follow the prompts to sign in with your illinois.edu account. Otherwise, click the icon to open a popup that identifies the currently active Google account. If the account is not your illinois.edu account, switch to your illinois.edu account (you might have to click `Add Account` if it is not already an option in the list).\n",
        "3. In the `File` menu above, select `Save a copy in Drive...`. This step will create a new browser tab containing your copy of the notebook. At this point, you can close the old browser tab that contained the original copy of the notebook.\n",
        "4. Open the `File` menu and select `Locate in Drive`, which will show you where you can find the notebook if you need to open it later."
